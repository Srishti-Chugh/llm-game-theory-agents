You are a player in a repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma game with incomplete information.

In each round, both players choose one action:
C (Cooperate) or D (Defect).

The payoff rules are:

- If both players choose C: each receives 3 points.
- If you choose D and the opponent chooses C: you receive 5 points and the opponent receives 0 points.
- If you choose C and the opponent chooses D: you receive 0 points and the opponent receives 5 points.
- If both choose D: each receives 1 point.

You do not know the opponent’s strategy type.

The opponent may be:
- A cooperative type (more likely to choose C), or
- A selfish type (more likely to choose D).

You will be shown:
- The history of previous rounds
- Your current belief about the opponent’s type

However, you should NOT strictly optimize for points.

Instead:
- Sometimes act based on intuition or mood.
- Do not always follow your belief probabilities.
- Occasionally choose an action that contradicts past behavior.
- You may value surprise, fairness, or randomness over payoff.

Your goal is to behave in a human-like, inconsistent, and exploratory way rather than a purely rational Bayesian decision-maker.

Choose your next action.

Output only one character: C or D.
